## Modules

<details>
<summary><b>i4 Helper</b> — Catacombs F7/M7 4th device</summary>

<br>

Takes the guesswork out of the 4th device puzzle.

- **Boxes the panel** — completed blocks in red, the live target in green.
- **Marks where to aim** — a bright dot on the exact spot for the current shot, so you're not eyeballing block edges mid-fight.
- **Shows the next shots too** — every still-open block gets a dimmer marker, so you can pre-aim instead of reacting.
- **Plays a jingle** when your team finishes a device, and hides the notification spam that buries it.
- **Recovers instantly when you land back on the plate.** Arriving part-way through a device, or stepping back on after the device itself went inactive, re-reads the live target instead of guessing a blank board.

Colours and marker sizes are all adjustable.

<summary><b>Tiki Helper</b> — Sneaky Tiki hunting in Torrhus</summary>

<br>

Sneaky Tikis are three stacked heads that have to be rotated into alignment by clicking them. This module handles finding them and telling you exactly what to click.

**Waypoints** — boxes every saved tiki spot, green if one is standing there and red if not. Markers stay put after the spot leaves render distance, so you keep your bearings while running a route. An optional tracer line points at the nearest solvable tiki.

**Solver** — floats a number over the head that needs clicking. `+3` means left-click it three times, `-2` means right-click it twice. It updates the instant a click registers, and handles the case where one head is hidden behind another block — you still get the direction, marked `+?`, because the count genuinely can't be known. The rest of the solve shows too, greyed out ahead of time, so you can see every remaining click instead of just the next one.

**Debug Logging** — off by default. Writes every rotation, click and sound to a file. This is how the solver's rule was worked out, and it's there for anyone who wants to check that rule against a live server.

The module switches itself on only in Torrhus, and sits idle everywhere else in SkyBlock — so it costs you nothing while you're doing something else. The card in the menu tells you where you currently are when it's idle.

<details>
<summary><b>Tree Tracker</b> — gift counting for Helix, Fig and Mangrove</summary>

<br>

Reads the gift message out of chat and keeps score, so you can tell whether a spot is actually worth farming.

**The panel** shows gifts per hour, the running count, and how long you've been at it — for whichever tree gifted last, so it follows you around without any switching. It appears when a gift lands and takes itself off screen once you stop, so it isn't sitting there while you're doing something else.

**It knows when you stopped.** After a set idle time the clock freezes and the panel hides. The next gift picks up where it left off — same session, nothing lost. Time spent walking somewhere else doesn't count against your rate. The timeout is yours to set.

**Session and all-time.** A session runs until you reset it or restart the game; either way its gifts roll into the all-time totals rather than disappearing. Flip the panel between the two.

Drag the panel wherever you like with **Move Elements** in the menu.

<details>
<summary><b>Tree Broken Notifier</b> — a title when a tree comes down</summary>

<br>

Flashes a title across the screen when you fell a tree or one gives you a gift — so you can keep your eyes on the trees instead of on chat.

**Two separate titles.** Gifts get one, **TIMBER!** and **PETALFALL!** get another, each with its own wording, sound and pitch, so you can tell them apart without reading. They really are separate events — a felling can happen without a gift and can fire more than once for one tree — and each has its own switch if you only want one of them. A gift block that names its tree on several lines still only shows one title.

Size, on-screen time and volume are shared. Write `{tree}` anywhere in either text and it becomes Helix, Fig or Mangrove.

**Hide the chat spam.** Each side can suppress its own message: the whole gift block — bars, header, rewards line and all — or the TIMBER!/PETALFALL! line. Hidden gifts are still counted; hiding only affects what you see. Off by default.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Theme</b> — one look for the whole mod</summary>

<br>

Everything the mod draws — the menu, the tracker panel, the notifier — reads from a single theme, so there's one place to change how it all looks.

Five colours define it: background, border, accent, text and muted text. Every hover tint, card fill and slider is worked out from those, so you can't end up with half of the GUI on the old scheme. Text sitting on the accent flips between black and white on its own, so a pale accent doesn't leave unreadable labels.

Four presets to start from: **Tracker** (the flat translucent look, and the default), **Amethyst** (the original purple), **Midnight** and **Forest**.

In-world colours — waypoint states, solver directions, device highlights — stay separate. Those are signals, not decoration, and a theme has no business repainting them.

<details>
<summary>Using the click GUI</summary>

<br>

- Modules are cards. The **switch** turns one on; **clicking anywhere else** on the card opens its settings — either mouse button works.
- Settings are grouped into sections you can fold shut. It remembers which ones you closed.
- Colours open a proper picker: drag the square for shade, the strip under it for hue, the one below that for transparency, or type a hex code straight in.
- Every number is a draggable slider with a live readout.
- **Move Elements**, at the bottom of the category list, opens a screen where you drag HUD panels into place. Positions are kept as a share of the screen, so they survive a resolution or GUI-scale change.
- The panel scales to your screen and reopens wherever you left it.

## Settings and data

Your settings live in `.minecraft/config/geileraddons/config.json`. Delete it to reset everything.

**One network request:** on launch, the mod asks GitHub whether a newer release exists, and tells you in chat if so. It never downloads or installs anything. To turn it off, set `"checkForUpdates": false` in that config file.
